# Python Keylogger

## Objective

This project was developed for the purposes of security research and forensic analysis with the aim of having a greater understanding of keylogging. This is my first in depth Python project. Though the code was simple, this project gave insight into how keylogging works and how to defend against it. The keylogger project was executed in a controlled environment and helped analyze how malicious threat actors use these kinds of tools. It reinforced the importance for detection techniques and good security practices. This hands-on work further honed my Python scripting skills and ethical hacking principles.

### Skills Learned

- Greater understanding of Python coding.
- Provided insights in how keylogging works.
- Adhered to ethical hacking principles.
- Enhanced knowledge of security vulnerabilities and a potential cybersecurity threat.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used

- PyCharm Community Edition

This screenshot shows the results of the keylogging code in a seperate text file that was created after inputs were given to the keyboard. I typed in a fake social security to highlight just how dangerous this keylogging code could be, and how threat actors may use this code.
